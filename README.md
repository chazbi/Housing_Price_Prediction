# Predict-Housing-Sale-Price
Goal is to predict the sale price of each house. For each Id in the test set, I predicted the value of the SalePrice variable. Metric.

# Data
The two datasets, training dataset and testing dataset, contain information of the residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The scope of the data needed for this research is 2500 observations for training data and 1500 observations for testing data. Without IDs, the training dataset consists of 79 explanatory variables and 1 response variable, ​SalePrice.​ The testing dataset has the same 79 explanatory variables without the response variable the model is trying to predict.

# This is an in-class Kaggle competition for UCLA STATS101A Winter 2019
The final rank for testing data prediction is 21/162 (top 13%) with R^2 of 0.94.
